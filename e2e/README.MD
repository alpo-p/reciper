I would love to run automated e2e tests. It's the missing piece in the puzzle. 

Unfortunately, my 6 years old laptop cannot run an android emulator without huge lagging. Therefore, running Detox isn't currently an option.

All the e2e testing is done via process of
1) Check the wireframe
2) Decide in my head what's the next end-to-end test that should pass
3) Develop the feature
4) Test manually on my Android phone by using expo
